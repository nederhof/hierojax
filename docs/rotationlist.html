<h1>Rotations</h1>

<p>
Below is a provisional list of <i>conceivable</i> rotations, compiled out of the file
<a href="rotations.js">rotations.js</a>. Not all of these rotations have
been attested yet, and we have erred on the side on anticipating more
potential rotations than may occur in actual texts. The motivation is that we
do not wish to place undue limitations on encoding projects in the near
future. Even so, it is very likely that encoders will come across rotations
that have been overlooked so far.
</p>
<p>
Where there is ambiguity between rotation clockwise and
counter-clockwise, we have opted for clockwise in the case of signs that 
in their most common form are wide and low, and for counter-clockwise in the
case of signs that in their most common form are tall and narrow.
If a potentially rotated shape can alternatively be obtained using mirroring, then mirroring is preferred.
</p>
<p>
The diagram has arrows that depict multiples of 45 degrees. Such
rotations correspond to one of 7 variation selectors.
Some arrows are followed by a positive or negative number, 
which denotes an additional angle in the clockwise direction (if positive) or
in the counter-clockwise direction (if negative). 
For example, an arrow depicting a 45 degree rotation followed by <b>-10</b> means that the
way the rotated sign should actually be depicted is with a rotation of 35 degrees.
</p>
<p>
<b>Some of the rotations in the below list probably need to be removed. In particular, signs
that are already diagonal but are rotated by say 30 degrees to be diagonal at
a slightly different angle do not merit to be distinguished. These cases are
temporarily here for demonstrative purposes.</b>
